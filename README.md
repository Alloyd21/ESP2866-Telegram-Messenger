# ESP2866 Telegram Messenger

A simple Arduino sketch to send messages via Telegram on button press. 

Similar to a hospital "Help Button", user presses the button, LED turns on indicating that a message has been sent and their request for assistance is still present. 

If the user or another user wants to cancel the request, the button can be pressed again and it will turn off. No additional message will be sent until the button is pressed again. 

Built for a ESP2866 NodeMCU V3 however should work on any ESP2866 board.
